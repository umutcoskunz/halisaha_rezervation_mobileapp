This project is a modern mobile football field reservation application built with Flutter, powered by a lightweight Node.js JSON-based backend. Users can register and log in using their email, username, or phone number, and they can view or update their profile information within the app.

Each listed football field includes detailed information such as city, price, capacity, and images, along with a weekly day–hour availability schedule. Users can browse this schedule and easily create reservations by selecting an available time slot.

All reservations are stored on the backend inside reservations.json, allowing users to track both their active and past reservations through the in-app “My Reservations” screen. Thanks to its JSON-based structure, the system remains simple, fast, and easy to maintain while providing a smooth and intuitive reservation experience.
